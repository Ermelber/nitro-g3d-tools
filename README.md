# Nitro G3D Tools
Collection of tools to convert models compatible with some Nintendo DS games.

# How to build
Install Visual Studio and build the solution. You need .NET Framework v4.7 in order to make this work properly.
Or just download the binaries here.

# Dependencies
Visual Studio should download the Nuget Packages when you build the solution.

If it doesn't, just reinstall [Assimp's Nuget Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AssimpNet/) (on ``LibNitroG3DTools``).

```Install-Package AssimpNet -Version 4.1.0```
